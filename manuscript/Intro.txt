Welcome to Drupal at your fingertips.  A Drupal 9 & 10 developer's quick code reference

This book is a quick reference for developers creating Drupal sites. While working on such sites during my career, I have gathered a large collection of notes and code which I use for my reference.  I hope it will be useful for you, too.

During my hunting through examples on Drupal.org, Stack Overflow and many other places, I often wished there was a succinct set of current annotated code samples explaining how to do things the Drupal way.  Of course, there is the excellent examples module, which is very handy. But this book is designed to otherwise fill that gap. Please forgive the `todo` items, but I've found that if I want to get it perfect, it won't ever get published. 


This book has it's origins as an online editable Github project where members of the Drupal community are invited to contribute.
