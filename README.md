# This is the repo for my Leanpub book, "Drupal at Your Fingertips"


Also in the "manuscript" folder, you will see a "resources" folder. Images and other resources are to be placed in this folder.

If you're looking for a tutorial, please select the Getting Started walkthrough for your chosen book writing mode [here](http://help.leanpub.com/en/articles/3088382-quick-walkthroughs-for-getting-started-on-a-leanpub-book) in our [Help Center](http://help.leanpub.com/en), which has hundreds of useful articles for Leanpub authors.

Finally, [here is a link to the Markua manual,](https://leanpub.com/markua/read) which shows you everything you can do when you write a book in plain text on Leanpub.

Good luck!
